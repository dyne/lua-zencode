This is the port of zenroom language ported out of [Zenroom](https://zenroom.org)'s VM to run on Lua 5.1 and all derivates (including Luajit, Nginx, Openresty and Tarantool).

Lua Zencode is an english-like [domain specific language (DSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) to easily write business logic and operate data transformation and authentication tasks using advanced crypto like [zero-knowledge proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) and [secure multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation).

This Lua module works only on 64-bit systems. For 32-bit support please use the Zenroom VM.

## 💾 Install

To build from source the following dependencies are needed:
```
gcc make cmake zsh
```

Then simply run the default targets of `Makefile`:
```
make && make install
```
Lua Zenroom will be installed in `/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1/libzenroom.so` and `/usr/local/share/lua/5.1/zenroom/`.

Luarocks spec file and upload is work in progress.

## 🎮 Quick start

To see Lua-Zenroom in action you can fire up the Lua interpreter loading `zenroom`

```
luajit -l zenroom
```

As a working example you can now generate an ECDH keypair

```
keypair = ECDH.keygen()
print(keypair.private)
print(keypair.public)
```

If you prefer to print them out in `base58` or `hex` encoding:

```
print(keypair.private:base58())
print(keypair.public:hex())
```

A [tutorial about crypto modeling with Zenroom in Lua](https://dev.zenroom.org/#/pages/lua) is also available.

## 🐝 API

Look at the [Zenroom internal API in Lua](https://dev.zenroom.org/#/pages/ldoc/o/README) to see the current API, more documentation will come soon.

You are welcome to join the [Zenroom telegram channel](https://t.me/zenroom) and ask for help.

---
## 📋 Testing

Run the test with

```
make check
```

The above includes NIST tests on hashing algorithms SHA256 and SHA512.

Random quality tests (FIPS140) need `rng-tools` to be installed, then run:

```
make check-random
```

---
## 🐛 Troubleshooting & debugging

There are some known issues under analysis:
- SHA3 functions are not yet passing NIST tests
- RNG determinism works but is not yet compatible with Zenroom VM

If you find any problem or suspicious behaviours please [open an issue](../../issues)

If you intend to use lua-zenroom in production please consider getting in touch with us.
